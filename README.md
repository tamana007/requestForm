Progressive Interculture Society Canada BC Fund Request System:

This project is a Next.js and MongoDB-based system developed for Progressive Interculture Society Canada BC. The system is designed to streamline the fund request process across all departments. Previously, this process was paper-based and could take up to a month to complete, involving obtaining signatures from department directors, approvals from the accounting and communication departments, and finalizing transactions with vendors.

By developing this application, I have significantly expedited the process, reducing it to a simple click. Now, fund requests are processed within minutes. The system utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and incorporates unique IDs for each department's approval process.
